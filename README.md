2. The AI-Agent Specialist: RAG-based Code Architect
Since AI is a primary differentiator in 2026, build a tool that helps developers apply LLD principles to their own code.

The Tech: MERN Stack, LangChain, Pinecone (Vector DB), and OpenAI/Gemini API.

The Concept: A platform where users upload a code snippet or a GitHub repo link. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to compare the code against design pattern documentation and SOLID principles.

Key Feature: The AI should generate a UML Class Diagram (using Mermaid.js) and suggest where a specific Design Pattern (like Observer or Singleton) could refactor the "spaghetti" code.

Why it works: It shows you can build AI applications that solve real-world engineering problems (developer productivity).
